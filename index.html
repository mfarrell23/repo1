    Hello! I am 34 and I have 2 kids. They are 7 and 14. I just got married last month and wanted to jump into a new career! I love sports and play on 3 soccer teams. I watch NBA and NFL but mostly just my teams. I realize my teams are not good at the moment but there will be a comeback.. I hope! I live in Utah and have a rottweiler named Raja. My little family is my world and I want to do everything I can to support them! I recently lost my grandfather, he was the most respected man in my community and it was and has been a very hard thing to deal with. I just celebrated my wedding without him and it was hard not to cry. I also just had my frist birthday without him.. I am hoping to start this new chapter off with this class and bang it out!
